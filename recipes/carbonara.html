            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Considered one of the three pasta dishes from Rome and being very popular worldwide, carbonara became one of Italy's most famous dishes.
                Because its key ingredients are not available everywhere in the world, there have been alterations such as using heavy cream and bacon instead of pecorino and guanciale
                that limit the true carbonara experience. The recipe I present to you is for the true carbonara experience (if some of the ingredients are not available near you, then some alterations
                are fine as long as you DON'T add cream).
            </p>
